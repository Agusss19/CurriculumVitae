\section{Experience}
\cventry{2021--actualidad}{Fullstack developer}{(.NET Core, React, Redux, NextJS) \href{https://www.fullstacklabs.co/}{Fullstack Labs}}{Remote}{}{Development of a system for MGM Resorts Company in the USA to book hotels, rooms, shows y entertainments along the country. The system was built using React (Hooks), Redux and NextJS for the Frontend and Apollo (GraphQL) for Backend communication. The application is orientated towards microfrontends (Webpack 5 - Module Federation), it uses the last cloud technologies of Azure. Some of the components used in the solution are Azure Storages and Functions. For the application testing we used Jest for unit testing and Cypress for the E2E testing. The Deploy to the different environments was carried out using the Azure DevOps service in order to compile the solution, run the unit tests, integration tests and finally pack and copy the resulting files to the destination server. It was also necessary an active participation in the client’s requirements and in the definition of the corresponding tasks. Technical advice was provided to some particular business needs. The agile methodology was Scrum, including all the instances with the client: daily, grooming, planning, retrospective.}

\cventry{2020--2021}{Fullstack developer}{(.NET Core, React, Redux, NextJS) \href{https://uruit.com/}{UruIT}}{Montevideo}{}{Development of a system for SupremeGolf Company in the USA to sell hours to play golf. The system was built using React (Hooks), Redux and NextJS for the Frontend .NET Core (C\#) for the Backend and the Dapper ORM for the communication with the SQL Server database. The application is orientated towards microservices (CQRS), it uses the last cloud technologies of Azure and paradigms such as DDD and dependency injection. Some of the components used in the solution are AppServices, Queues, Topics, Functions and Redis cache. For the application testing we used Jest in the Frontend and XUnit in the Backend. The Deploy to the different environments was carried out using the Azure DevOps service in order to compile the solution, run the unit tests, integration tests and finally pack and copy the resulting files to the destination server. It was also necessary an active participation in the client’s requirements and in the definition of the corresponding tasks. Technical advice was provided to some particular business needs.

\cventry{2019--2019}{Fullstack developer}{(.NET Core, React, Redux) \href{https://www.novit.com.ar/}{Novit}}{CABA}{}{Development of a system for the City Parking Company in Colombia in a remote way from La Plata. The project business aim consisted in the handling of the parking quota for cars, motorbikes and bicycles of all the country. The system was built using React and Redux for the Frontend together with the PWA technology to simulate a mobile application and could be used even when there was no connection to Internet. It was required knowledge about .NET Core (C\#) for the backend and the Entity Framework ORM for the SQL Server database. Initially the architecture was in layers, afterwards changed to slices (CQRS and DDD).  For the application testing we used Jest in the Frontend and XUnit in the Backend. The Deploy to the environments was carried out using Docker containers in Azure. The agile methodology used was Scrum with Trello tools (and Power Ups). It was also necessary an active participation in the client’s requirements and in the definition of the corresponding tasks. Technical advice was provided to some particular business needs.}

\cventry{2017--2019}{Desarrollador Fullstack}{(.NET Core, React, Redux) \href{https://www.cgp.gba.gov.ar/}{General Accounting Office of the Province of Buenos Aires}}{La Plata}{}{Creation of internal applications to automate activities and processes that before were carried out manually. Each application was given a solution according to the problem presented. The systems were built using React and Redux for the Frontend,.NET Core (C\#) for the Backend and the NHibernate ORM for the communication with Oracle and SQL Server database.
For the development of these systems, large-range knowledge on software architecture was required (layers, vertical slices, CQQRS, DDD, dependency injection). It was used Jest in the Frontend and XUnit in the Backend for the testing. The deploy of the different environments was carried out using the Jenkins tool. It was necessary to create a Powershell script capable of creating the site in IIS, compiling the solution, executing the unit tests, the integration tests and finally packing and copying the resulting files to the destination server (Windows Server). This is the way in which the continuous integration paradigm/deploy was carried out. The development methodology was Scrum using tools like Trello, Slack.}

Both subjects consist in learning this language together with the most common design patterns used in the business world.}

\cventry{2017--2018}{Software Developer}{(Java, C++) \href{https://www.linti.unlp.edu.ar/}{New computer technologies research Laboratory}}{La Plata}{}{Development of the research system “Creation of devices based on sensors and specific software to improve the training of athletes”. The project was approved in the call for “Applications development and innovation projects” at the Computer Science Faculty in 2017. The system consists in a component that controls the microcontrollers called “Terminal” and a series of peripheral devices called “Turtles”. The first one runs in Android mobiles and it was written using Java. The peripherals on the other hand were programmed using C++ and the SDK of ESP8266. The aim was to sense the reaction capacity of the athletes who tried the system. Then, the information was centralized in a cloud database. The communication between the different system components was carried out through its own binary protocol implemented over WiFi (UDP and TCP).}
